    \section{Which ciphers offer harder reversibility; Block or Stream? Why?}
    The block ciphers are harder to reverse.
    A stream cipher might only include Substitutions of the bits in the stream and no additional permutation (as the nature of the stream must be given).
    Thus the block cipher can add an extra layer of security by using not only substitution but also permutation.

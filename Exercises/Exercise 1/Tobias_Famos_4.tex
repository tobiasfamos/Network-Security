    \section*{Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.}
    The difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption lies in the knowledge of the keys.
    In symmetric encryption, both parties have the same keys whereas in asymmetric encryption the parties have different keys.

    Thus in the core, the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is the possibility to decrypt a cypher with the encryption key (symmetric) or only with a second key (asymmetric)

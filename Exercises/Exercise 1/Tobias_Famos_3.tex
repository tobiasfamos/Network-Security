    \section*{Explain the difference between security services and security mechanisms.}

    A \textbf{security service} describes the whole process of ensuring one of the goals of network security (or security in general).
    A \textbf{security mechanism} describes one single component of this security service, which aims at increasing security or decreasing loss of a breach.
    Thus, the relation between a security service, and a security mechanisms can be stated as follows:
    \begin{quote}
        A \textbf{security service} tries to secure communication or data by employing one, or many \textbf{security mechanisms}
    \end{quote}
    A few examples for \textbf{Security Services}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Authentication and Authorization
        \item Encryption
        \item Physical Device Security and Access Restrictions
    \end{itemize}
    A few examples for \textbf{Security Mechanisms} (corresponding to the above security services):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item OAuth2.0 or JWT
        \item RSA Encryption
        \item Physical locks on doors to the server room
    \end{itemize}
